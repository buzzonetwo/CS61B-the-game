# CS61B: THE HYPE IS REAL
A fun little game that Samir Naqvi, a good friend of mine, and I worked on for project 2 of CS61B. It is written in Java and features a tile engine created by the 61B course staff and utilizes the Princeton StdDraw library. A lot of hours were put during the three weeks that we worked on it since the rest was basically made from scratch.

# Game Mechanics
WASD to move, UHJK to scroll, T to teleport.

Different difficulties (ZHX) have variable scoring mechanics, but moving, running into walls, and teleporting all cost a certain amount of points. You can gain points by picking up flowers. The game ends when you reach the exit or run out of points.

The sequence ":q" saves the game and allows you to load the game from the home screen.

Using the same seed for a game will create the same floorplan.
